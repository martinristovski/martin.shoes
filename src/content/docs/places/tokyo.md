I'll preface this by saying that I'm mostly using by best judgement to offer recommendations here, as I haven't been to Tokyo myself. If you ever plan on visiting New York, I'm happy to talk about the shoe situation here in far more detail. Tokyo is one of the top 3 cities in the world when it comes to the retail presence of welted footwear, with the other two being New York and London. With that said, you'll mostly want to be focusing on Japanese (and East Asian) brands, as European and American shoes tend to be more expensive. There are a few Japanese entry level dress shoe brands, but given the present state of your collection, I will skip them. It's also getting late here, so there won't be a whole lot of detail for each brand from me, but I've tried to add relevant links to blog posts where I could find them, and I hope you enjoy reading them. If you run into questions about any of the brands mentioned below, feel free to ask me and I'll do my best to point you in the right direction.

These three are bigger, multi-brand retailers. They tend to focus a little more on dress shoes, but there are plenty of casual options, and I recommend checking them out:

- [World Footwear Gallery](https://shoegazing.com/2016/08/21/report-world-footwear-gallery/)
- [Isetan Men's Shoe Department](https://shoegazing.com/2016/03/14/report-isetan-mens-shoe-department/)
- [Trading Post](https://www.instagram.com/tradingpost_ruggedstore/)

The next three are more so places to visit rather than places to buy from:

- [Super 8 Shoes](https://vcleat.com/super-8-shoes/) - vintage shoe store
- [Viberg Japan Storefront](https://www.instagram.com/vibergjapan/) - 2 Chome-54-5 Nihonbashi Hamacho, Chuo City, Tokyo 103-0007
- [White Kloud](https://old.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/comments/9wot2c/trip_report_a_visit_to_brass_tokyo_and_white/) - Goto-san, the one man behind the one-man shop, is pretty much as close as you get to fully bespoke footwear in the Amekaji scene. I imagine he's plenty busy, but you could always reach out and see if there's a chance you can visit his workshop. [Here's his Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/show_goto/).

Below is a list of mid-range to high-end brands that are all on the more casual side of things. I've tried to approximately sort them by price. There are probably some brands I've missed.
