## What does proper sizing mean?

In general, the vast majority of people size shoes off of the total length of the shoe and the total length of the foot. With something like a sneaker, you can get away with doing that as the shoe is very flexible, but with more structured footwear like the kind we talk about here, that's not how it works. You want *enough* toe room, of course, but a shoe like this only really wants to flex at one point -- the deepest point of the forefoot. [Here's a picture to help show what I mean by "deepest"](https://i.imgur.com/3VwWARX.png). Your foot, incidentally, also only really wants to flex at one point -- the ball of your foot, which is where the heads of the metatarsal bones are. [Here's an illustration of the bones of the medial side of the foot](https://i.imgur.com/paZfhYx.jpeg). The blue line is the head of the first metatarsal bone. To make the mechanics of it all make sense, we want the red line from the first picture and the blue line from the second picture to line up. This will also result in the arch curve of your foot being properly aligned with that of the shoe.

## How do I get my proper size?

The best way we have to get reliable sizing information is by taking pictures of your feet on a [Brannock device](https://brannock.com/collections/products/products/mens-brannock-device). This is the part that's a little more expensive outside of the US. They're also available on Amazon, but you may have to pay a good bit more for shipping. In my opinion, buying a Brannock is still worth it. In the US, it costs $70. Even if you pay another $70 for shipping, you're still spending less than you would lose by reselling a single missized pair of boots. 

In the US, I recommend buying a Brannock as opposed to finding one in a store for multiple reasons: people feel rushed in a store, many stores have weird shoe sizing devices that are either from other companies, or have the wrong scale, or are just in bad condition, but again, most importantly, a Brannock is $70, which is less than the loss you would make if you had to resell even just a single pair of missized entry level GYW shoes.


## What is a Brannock device?

The Brannock device gives you three measurements for each foot: the heel to toe length, the heel to ball length, and the width. The heel to toe length is as simple as it sounds -- the US men's size that the  total length of your foot corresponds to. The heel to ball size, however, is where the magic happens. It tells you, effectively, the US men's size that corresponds to the length of your foot from the heel to that blue line in the picture from the previous paragraph. Many people, quite possibly a majority of the population, have feet with toes that are short relative to their heel-to-ball length. If those people size off of their total length, they're wearing shoes that are too small. The third measurement -- the width -- tells you how wide your foot is relative to other feet of the same length. By length here, I mean the greater of your heel to ball size and heel to toe size. Of course, these three measurements don't tell you everything. Instep height, toe splay, ankle width, etc. are all things that can influence fit, but Brannock measurements arte a great foundation and allow us to provide reliable sizing advice for any last out there. If you're interested in this, I'm happy to talk about the details of using a Brannock more, but the [instructions page](https://brannock.com/pages/instructions-fitting-tips) on their website provides a good overview of how things work.


## How do I use a Brannock device?

Asking for sizing advice? Follow the instructions below.

Have your Brannock size? Great! Prove it with a picture.

Don't have your Brannock size? Buy a Brannock device and post pictures of your feet and someone will help you. Only purchase an official men's or combination men's/women's device. Do NOT let someone else measure you. Do NOT use another brand of foot measuring device. Do NOT use UK or EU devices and try to convert to US. Do not use a shoe measuring device that is not labelled as an Official Brannock Device.

TAKE PICTURES WEARING SOCKS.

Follow the instructions at https://brannock.com/pages/instructions-fitting-tips while paying special attention to Section 3 where there are instructions for measuring the Arch Length (Heel-to-Ball).

Any advice provided prior to this information is speculation. Information based on existing sizes you wear is unreliable until a Brannock size is confirmed.
