## Deciphering Shoe Inscriptions

All Alden shoes have an inscription on the medial side of the shoe that contains basic information about the shoe. 

![Alden Inscription](../../../assets/makers/alden/alden-inscription.jpg)

The format is as follows:

Starting from the left, we have the length and width. The width on all Alden lasts is indicated separately for the heel and the ball, because their lasts are combination lasts. Since the difference between the two widths is always 2 (AAA/A, B/D, E/EE, etc.), we can essentially ignore the (narrower) heel width and just focus on the ball width.

Moving on to the right, the top line indicates the run number. The first two characters indicate the year and month of production. The number is the final digit of the manufacturing year, and the letter is the month. So, for example, 3B could be February of 2023, 2013, 2003, etc. A small exception here is that the letter I is skipped, so the months are: A=January, B=February, C=March, D=April, E=May, F=June, G=July, H=August, J=September, K=October, L=November, M=December. The following two characters are numbers which indicate the order number that was submitted to the factory (e.g. by a retailer ordering a special makeup). The following three characters are the batch number. The final number on the top line, separated by a space, is the pair number, which matches between the left and right shoe.

The bottom line contains only the model code. Stock models and makeups older than 2013 maintain their existing model codes, which sometimes have some sense to them but oftentimes are inscrutable. Starting with stockist makeups in 2013, Alden introduced a new model code schema which is much more consistent. To the best of my ability to find information on the topic, the schema is defined as follows:

[R][1][2][34][XX]

[R] is a letter indicating the region. 
  - A = Asia with the exception of Japan
  - D = USA
  - G = Canada
  - M = Europe
  - N = Japan

[1] is a number indicating the last digit of the year in which the makeup was first introduced.

[2] is a number indicating the category of shoe.
  - 1 = tassel loafers and slip-ons
  - 2 = all other loafers
  - 3 = all oxfords
  - 4 = plain toe derbies
  - 5 = cap toe and wingtip derbies
  - 6 = moc toe, apron toe, norwegian split toe, and algonquin toe derbies
  - 7 = two-eyelet chukka boots and george boots
  - 8 = plain toe, cap toe, and wingtip boots
  - 9 = moc toe, apron toe, norwegian split toe, and algonquin toe boots

[34] is the number of that particular makeup of that year and [1][2] category, incrementing by one in chronological order.

[XX] is a zero to two letter code that indicates certain features of the makeup. The following codes are known as of early 2024:
  - C = Alden commando half sole
  - D = Dainite sole
  - F = flex welt
  - H = speed hooks
  - S = lug sole
  - U = unlined
  - Y = wider welt

A few other feature markers are known to have been used on model codes before 2013:
  - E = exposed eyelets
  - M = Eduard Meier makeups (a German retailer)
  - R = thin rubber sole
