If you're very short on time, the two places with the most coverage are Standard & Strange (SoHo) and Leffot (West Village), as both are retailers that stock multiple brands. Outside of that, there are Alden Madison, Moulded Shoe, Allen Edmonds, Belgian Shoes, and Carmina near Grand Central; Crockett & Jones, R.M. Williams, Meermin, and Drake's in SoHo; Thursday's store is near Flatiron, Nepenthes is next to PABT, John Lobb and The Armoury have locations in Lenox Hill, and The Armoury is also in Tribeca. Occasionally, Viberg hosts sample sales, which tend to happen in NYC more often than not.

For all the stuff that you can't find in New York easily (as well as general fine leather footwear extravaganza), some time in October, [Stitchdown Boot Camp](https://www.stitchdownbootcamp.com/) will take place in NYC. It's essentially a fine leather footwear convention, mostly focusing on the casual side of things. You get to see and try on shoes from a lot of brands that don't have a physical retail presence, talk to the people that run them, and in general spend a couple of days nerding out about shoes with the only people in the world who are willing to talk to you about it for hours on end. If you intend to visit New York at some point, this is a great time to do so. The weather is perfect that time of year, and Boot Camp is only a couple of days, so there could be plenty of time left to explore the rest of the city, both from a footwear aspect and in general.
