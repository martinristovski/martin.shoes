## Alexander
The Alexander last is used for the Traveler penny loafer, and the tassel loafer. It has a snug heel and a slightly lower instep than Leo, with a relatively roomy round toe. We recommend going half down from Brannock if you have a medium to low volume foot. If you have a high volume foot, we recommend going down 1/2 size from Brannock and going up 1 width.

## Floyd
The Floyd last is a high volume, round toe last with raised sidewalls. It's used for the Brass boot and the Field boot. We recommend going half down from Brannock.

## Leo
The Leo last is a relatively low volume, straight, almond toe last. It is by far Grant Stone's most popular last. It is used for the following patterns: Diesel, Edward, Ottawa, Cap Toe, Chukka, Garrison, Country Derby, Longwing, Plain Toe Blucher, and Dirty Buck. We recommend sizing down 1/2 size from your Brannock size if you have a medium to low volume foot. If you have a high volume foot, we recommend sizing down 1/2 size from your Brannock size and going up 1 width.

## Naples
The Naples last is a round toe last used for the Coast Sneaker. Since it only comes in full sizes, we recommend going true to size, or sizing up if you are in between sizes.

## Oliver
The Oliver last is used for Grant Stone's oxfords. We recommend going with your Brannock size.

## UK
The UK last is used for the men's Chelsea boot. It has a taller instep and an almond toe. We recommend going half down from Brannock, with the caveat that the last may not work for you if you have particularly low volume feet.

## Women's Line

As of January 2024, Grant Stone's women's line has two lasts: the Nora, used on the Nora lace up boot, and the Josephine, used on the women's Chelsea boot. We do not currently have much information about the two lasts, but will update this page as we learn more. Grant Stone's recommendation is to take your normal women's size.
