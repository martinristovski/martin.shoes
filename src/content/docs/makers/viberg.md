description: Viberg sizing and lasts.

One of the things that complicates Viberg sizing is that a lot of the sizing advice there from stockists and even Viberg themselves is... wrong. You should be taking a Viberg stamped size (what they sometimes call a UK size) half down from your US size, not a full size down. Which is to say, if you're a 10D US, you want a 9.5E in 2030, 2040, 1035, etc. This is what results in optimal alignment of the flex point of your foot with the flex point of the shoe. At this point, I've seen dozens of people transition from going a full size down to going a half size down and none have regretted it.
