## 1228 Last
The 1228 last is a D-width round toe last with a relatively tall instep, a narrow heel, and a light outward swing, resulting in more room on the lateral side of the foot. We recommend going half a size down from your Brannock size.

## 314 Last
The 314 last is an E-width last and is aesthetically quite similar to the 1228 last, but with more volume in the forefoot. It has a round toe, a tall instep, and a narrow heel. We recommend going half a size down from your Brannock size, with the caveat that this last may not work for people with low volume feet.
