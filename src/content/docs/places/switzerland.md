Looks like Recall Clothing in Geneva stocks Viberg, or at least used to until recently, and thereâ€™s also Dee Cee Style in Zurich. They currently have [this makeup](https://deeceestyle.ch/products/viberg-boondocker-marine-field-roughout-suede-boot) in stock, which is inspired by WW2 American infantry boots and is exclusive to Dee Cee Style. Moving beyond Switzerland, there's:

- [Denim Heads](https://denimheads.cz/collections/brand-viberg) in Prague
- [Statement Store](https://statement-store.com/collections/footwear/products/viberg-2030-service-boot-brown-chromexcel) in Munich
- [Royalcheese](https://www.royalcheese.com/fr/364-bottes?q=Marque-ALDEN+SHOE+CO-PARABOOT-VIBERG-YUKETEN) in Paris, which also stocks Paraboot, a mid-range French brand who makes chunkier shoes that are somewhat dress shoe-adjacent like their [Avignon](https://www.royalcheese.com/fr/paraboot/17206-105533-chaussures-avignon.html#/3762-taille-415/4568-couleur-brown) or [Chambord](https://www.royalcheese.com/fr/paraboot/11302-85005-paraboot-chambord-marron.html#/3930-taille-395/4568-couleur-brown)
- [Burg & Schild](https://www.burgundschild.com/de/schuhe/?p=1) in Berlin, which has Alden and Viberg, but also a couple of more niche Japanese brands, like [Black Sign](https://www.burgundschild.com/de/detail/index/sArticle/3878), [2 Monkeys](https://www.burgundschild.com/de/detail/index/sArticle/4299), and [Brother Bridge](https://www.burgundschild.com/de/listing/manufacturer/sSupplier/155)
- [Stuf|f](https://www.stuf-f.com/bekleidung/schuhe/) in Dusseldorf, which has a bunch of interesting stuff, like [Y'2](https://www.stuf-f.com/bekleidung/schuhe/1721/y-2-leather-aniline-horse-work-boots-cherry-ls-02), [Clinch](https://www.stuf-f.com/bekleidung/schuhe/2341/clinch-yeager-boots-horsebutt), [Addict](https://www.stuf-f.com/bekleidung/schuhe/4110/addict-clothes-ab-06h-cl-lw-horsehide-service-boots-brown), [the 2 Monkeys Sportif from above in a different leather](https://www.stuf-f.com/bekleidung/schuhe/4122/jelado-the-2-monkeys-sportif-bordeaux-vachetta), [Skoob](https://www.stuf-f.com/bekleidung/schuhe/3175/skoob-x-stuf-f-m-43-service-shoes-brown-horse-butt), Viberg, Alden etc.
- [Clutch Cafe](https://clutch-cafe.com/collections/footwear), [East West Apparel](https://eastwestapparel.co.uk/shop/browse/boots-shoes/), and [Rivet and Hide](https://rivetandhide.com/shop/categories/footwear.html) in the UK. I'm not sure if the import fee situation is different for Switzerland when it comes to EU vs UK, but check them out. They have some fun shoes.

For J.M. Weston, it looks like they have a store right in Geneva. I imagine they'll be able to order something you like on the website even if they don't have it in store at the moment. Their most iconic style is probably the [180 Loafer](https://eu.jmweston.com/en/collections/mocassins-homme/products/mocassin-180-homme-cuir-veau-velours-beachnut), which would pair great with your outfits. They also have derbies in a style similar to that of Paraboot, though a bit more refined (and better finished, given the price). Examples include the [Golf](https://eu.jmweston.com/en/collections/derbies-homme/products/derby-golf-homme-cuir-veau-box-bergeronnette-piqure-contrastee-ecrue), [Half-Hunt](https://eu.jmweston.com/en/collections/derbies-homme/products/derby-demi-chasse-cuir-veau-box-marron-bergeronnette-homme), and [Hunt](https://eu.jmweston.com/en/collections/derbies-homme/products/derby-chasse-cuir-veau-finition-russia-marron-chene-homme).

Oh and, you may already be familiar with the Alden stockist situation in the area, but for future reference, along with some of the places mentioned above, there's [Trunk Clothiers](https://www.trunkclothiers.com/products/alden-unlined-penny-loafer-snuff-suede-6243f?variant=15417581469731) in Zurich, there's [Upper Shoes](https://www.upper-shoes.com/en/collections/alden-mens-shoes), which has a location in Lyon, as well as a couple of other places in France, and Anatomica Paris, which is one of those quaint in-person only shops that stocks Alden's Modified last. If you're ever in Paris, I highly recommend paying them a visit.
