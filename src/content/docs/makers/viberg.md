description: Viberg sizing and lasts.
---

One of the things that complicates Viberg sizing is that a lot of the sizing advice out there from stockists and even Viberg themselves is... wrong. In the vast majority of cases, you should be taking a Viberg stamped size (what they sometimes call a UK size) half down from your US size, not a full size down. Which is to say, if you're a 10D US, you want a 9.5E in all of their service boot lasts (2030, 2040, 1035, etc.). This is what results in optimal alignment of the flex point of your foot with the flex point of the shoe. At this point, I've seen dozens of people transition from going a full size down to going a half size down and none have regretted it. Additionally, Viberg's widths are not the same as those on a US Brannock device. Viberg D width is narrower than a Brannock D width, and Viberg E width is narrower than a Brannock E width. Viberg E width is roughly equivalent to a Brannock D width.

## 1004
The 1004 cantilever last is an anatomical, low-volume swing last with an asymmetrical almond toe. We recommend going with your Brannock size.

<!-- ## 1005 -->

## 110
The 110 is a round, high volume last that only comes in a Viberg EEE width. It's short past the ball, so people with HTT greater than or equal to their HTB or significant toe splay may run into issues. Recently, it has been most commonly found on the 145 Oxford pattern, but there have also been 146 Rigger lace to toe boots, 245 lace to toe oxfords, bobcats, chukkas, service boots, and boondockers. We recommend going half down from Brannock for this last, but if you are considering a 145 or 245 and have short toes and narrower heels, you may want to go a full size down.

<!-- ## 160 -->

## 1035
The 1035 has a wide heel relative to Viberg's other lasts, and a wide toebox, halfway between 2030 and 2040. It comes in an E width, and is most commonly found on service boots, bobcats, 145s, and other casual patterns. We recommend going half down from Brannock on this last, with the caveat that the wide heel can make it difficult to fit if you have narrower heels and are interested in a shoe pattern like the 145.

<!-- ## 2010 -->

## 2020
The 2020 is a relatively anatomical, lower-volume last, with a narrow heel and waist, a more sculpted arch, and an outward swing that results in more room on the medial side of the toebox and less room on the lateral side. It has historically only been available in a Viberg D width, but recently has been available in an E width as well. It has been used on service boots, derby boots, derby shoes, rockland bluchers, halketts, and bastion oxfords. We recommend going half down from Brannock on this last. If you are a higher volume D width, you may need to look for the E width version of this last, which is only available on a small number of makeups starting in late 2023. We do not recommend this last for people with feet wider than a Brannock D width. 

## 2030
The 2030 is Viberg's most popular last. It is also the last that has undergone the most changes over the years. What all versions of the 2030 have in common, is that they are a fairly straight, almond shaped last, with newer versions having increasingly rounder toes. We recommend going half down from Brannock on all versions of 2030. Generally, older versions of the last will have less volume than newer versions, especially in the toebox. Newer iterations are available in the standard Viberg E width, as well as D and EE on some makeups.

## 2040
The 2040 is a Munson-inspired last with a narrow heel and waist, and a wide toebox which is flat on the medial side. It has a lower instep than Viberg's other service boot lasts, and only comes in a Viberg E width. We recommend going half down from Brannock. The lower instep can make it difficult to fit if you have a high instep or generally higher-volume feet. In such cases, the 2045 and 2055 would offer a similar Munson-inspired design with more room all around.

## 2045
The 2045 is a Munson-inspired last, like the 2040 above, with a structured bump toe. It comes in a Viberg EE width. We recommend taking it half down from Brannock.

## 2050
The 2050 is a laterally narrow almond toe last with a high instep. It comes in a Viberg D width, and has been used on engineers and chelsea boots. We recommend going half down from Brannock, but you may want to go true to size if you see yourself needing the extra toe room. We do not recommend this last for people with a low instep.

## 2055
The 2055 is very similar to the 2045, with the exception of the bump toe. 2055 makeups have unstructured toes. It comes in a Viberg EE width. We recommend taking it half down from Brannock.

<!-- ## 240 -->

## 310
The 310 is a sprung toe last with a voluminous, boxy toe with raised sidewalls. It comes in a Viberg E width and (much less commonly) a D width. We recommend going half down from Brannock.
