description: Red Wing sizing and lasts.

:::caution
Red Wing's retail presence in the US leads to them being a common first boot for many people. Unfortunately, many people are fitted incorrectly and end up with boots that are too small, because salespeople are not trained to have a good understanding of fit and sizing. This is a common problem with many brands, but it is particularly bad with Red Wing. In addition to a lack of training, Red Wing's lasts tend to be narrow but high volume. This high volume makes people think that they should size down more than is appropriate.

A recent development that has made things worse is the replacement of their in-store Brannock devices with Volumental scanners. These scanners should not be used to size people for welted footwear, as they do not give you the most important measurement of all: the heel-to-ball size. If you are reading this and do not know your Brannock size in detail (heel to ball, heel to toe, and width, for each foot) I strongly recommend reading the [Brannock](../introduction/brannock/) page before proceeding any further.

The goal of break-in is to get the sole used to flexing at its natural flex point, not to suffer through the pain of a boot that is too small. If you are experiencing pain, you should stop wearing the boots and consider sizing up or looking at other lasts from other makers.

## 8 Last
The 8 last is a fairly straight last with a voluminous, tall, bump toe. It is used for the Iron Ranger, Blacksmith, Beckman, and Classic Chelsea. We recommend going half a size down from your Brannock size and no more.

## 23 Last
The 23 last is relatively narrow throughout the foot but has raised sidewalls and a lot of vertical space. It is used for all of Red Wing's moc toe boots. We recommend going half a size down from your Brannock size and no more.
